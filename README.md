**This repo has been archived for two reasons. First, the naming of the repo
"lv89" is inaccurate as Ukkonen first [found][U83] the algorithm implemented
here (see also [#4](https://github.com/lh3/lv89/issues/4)). Second, the implementation is inefficient. When I have
time, I may reimplement the algorithm along the direction of
[miniwfa](https://github.com/lh3/miniwfa).**

## Getting Started

```sh
# Compile the test program for lv89 and edlib
git clone https://github.com/lh3/lv89
cd lv89
make
./ed-test -c test/t2-t.fa test/t2-q.fa

# Compile with WFA2
git clone https://github.com/lh3/lv89
cd lv89
git clone https://github.com/smarco/WFA2-lib
(cd WFA2-lib && make)
make WFA2_ROOT=WFA2-lib
```

## Introduction

This repo provides a reasonably fast yet lightweight implementation of the
[Landau-Vishkin][lv89]/[Myers86][myers86] algorithm to compute the edit
distance between two strings, in a formulation inspired by [WFA2][WFA2]. This
repo doesn't aim at the fastest implementation. It is usually slower than
[edlib][edlib] and [WFA2][WFA2] but is simpler.

## The algorithm

The basic LV89 algorithm does global alignment. It takes *O*(*nd*) time and
*O*(*d*) space to compute the distance, where *n* is the length of the longer
sequence and *d* is their edit distance. Deriving the base alignment requires
*O*(*d*<sup>2</sup>) space, which could be significant even when this repo uses
only 2 bits per entry.

To alleviate this issue, we employed a divide-and-conquer approach inspired by
[Hirschberg's algorithm][lin-space]. We split the alignment into ceil(*d*/*q*)
blocks where each block, except the last one, has edit distance exactly *q*.
We then perform base alignment inside each block. The new algorithm takes
*O*(*n*(*d*+*q*)) in time and *O*(*d*\*ceil(*d*/*q*)+*q*<sup>2</sup>) in space.
When *q* equals 1000, the space can be reduced by tens of folds in practice in
comparison to the basic algorithm. I later realized that this is somewhat
similar to [Eizenga and Paten (2022)][EP22], though the other algorithm does
not explicitly segment the alignment.

## Brief benchmark

We only use two pairs of sequences for evaluation. The first pair consists of
the two haplotypes of NA19240 around the C4A/C4B gene. They are 100-150kb in
length with an edit distance of 26k. The second pair consists of GRCh38 and
CHM13 around MHC. They are about 5Mb in length with an edit distance of 123kb.
These sequences can be found [via Zenodo][seq-zenodo].

|WFA2-high|Y |-wcm3     |74          |58937       |2.51       |3123828|

[edlib][edlib] is the overall winner. It is fast and uses the least memory.
[WFA2][WFA2] is slower on the C4 sequences probably because lv89 prunes
diagonals that are unlikely to yield better alignments (this is not a
heuristic). WFA2 also uses more memory to generate base alignment. Nonetheless,
WFA2 is the only library here that supports affine gap penalties, which will be
crucial to many biological applications.

## Historical notes on O(nd) algorithms

Ukkonen found the first *O*(*nd*) algorithm to compute edit distances. The
work was established in 1983 and [published in 1985][U83]. Landau and Vishkin
cited Ukkonen's work but ~~presented it in a different formulation which is
closer to the modern formulation implemented here.~~ Landau and Vishkin submitted
their paper in 1986 and [published in 1989][lv89]. Meanwhile, Myers
independently published another *O*(*nd*) algorithm [in 1986][myers86].
His formulation is almost identical to Landau-Vishkin's. Each of the three
papers also described additional algorithms (for example, Myers (1986) gave a
linear-space algorithm to find base alignment, inspired by Hirschberg (1975);
Landau and Vishkin (1989) introduced suffix trees to speed up search).
Nonetheless, these papers are more often remembered as the first batch of
papers on the *O*(*nd*) algorithm.

[Edlib][edlib] implements Myers' [bit-parallel algorithm][myers-bit] published in 1999. The basic
bit-parallel algorithm is *O*(*mn*/*w*) in time, where *w* is the number of
bits in an integer. This algorithm is easy to implement. The full algorithm
has an *O*(*nd*/*w*) expected (not worse-case) time complexity. Implementing
this algorithm is much more challenging. Edlib additionally supports base
alignment in linear space. It is an engineering feat and the best overall
library for edit distance.

The search for an *O*(*nd*) algorithm with linear or affine gap penalties took
much longer. To the best of my knowledge, [Xin et al][leap] first found this
algorithm but apparently they have never published the result in a
peer-reviewed journal. [WFA][WFA2] is the first published algorithm. It also
comes with a highly efficient implementation, beating all global alignment
algorithms by a large margin. WFA is the best overall library for global and
semi-global alignment under affine gap penalties.
